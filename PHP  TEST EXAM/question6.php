// QUESTION 6
// consider the following array
$indexed_array = array('fruit' => 'apple',
                        'select_name' => 'john',
                        'select_animal' => 'cat',
                        'number' => '23',
                        'select_car' => 'toyota',
                        'plant' => 'rose',
                        'color' => 'blue',
                        'select_other' => ': this is awesome');

// Create an output array that contains all array entries from $indexed_array which keys (index) starts with "select_", keep both the key and value in tact
// Then update the new array to remove the "select_" part of the keys, but keeping the rest as is
// Print out every key and value pair in the array on a new line, in the format "key => value" 
// Update the output so that every line is followed by the current date and time in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss (eg. 2013-12-15 23:06:59)
// (Note) Don't type out the date and time, let PHP generate it
